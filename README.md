# OUSAreports

Script to generate visual financial reports for OrigamiUSA from XLS reports
generated by Sage accounting software. Originally written in MATLAB in 2013, it
was ported to a client-side javascript web 
[application](https://origamimagiro.github.io/OUSAreports/) in 2022. 

To use, upload two monthly reports from SAGE:

- "Budget vs Actual All Depts" 
- "GL Expenses to Income"

Example import files can be found in the ex/ folder.

The software will generate three exports:

- PDF: A graphical summary of the month's finances
- Budget Summary: A formatted CSV containing categorized budget data
- Transactions: A formatted CSV containing categorized transaction data
